    "description": "⭐ Fragrantica's Best in Show, Soapy Perfumes, 11/09/21\nA cloak of rich green velvet sweeps across the Australian horizon, the majestic eucalypt forest flattering every curve of the undulating landscape. Tucked high in the crook of a tree, the koala is oblivious to the mesmerizing views. It would rather curl into a ball and sleep off a feast of oily eucalyptus, the aromatic leaves that sustain it. Despite their sleepy demeanour and friendly expression, koalas are territorial creatures. Males mark the soaring trunks with their musk, establishing their dominance.\nZoologist Koala opens with an invigorating blend of lemony honey and the sweet aroma of eucalyptus. They float above a blanket of black tea and spices, then draw you even deeper into musky amber and woods. The result is a unique and carefree scent that snuggles in around you, enveloping you in an embrace both playful and independent.\nPerfumer: Spyros DrosopoulosSize: 1.5 mL / 0.05 fl. oz.
