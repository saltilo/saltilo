    "description": "The frail glow of the waning moon dwindles until only impenetrable blackness persists across the grasslands. A herd of deer venture tentatively into the expanse. Though their long necks dip to feed, their dainty legs remain tense, poised to flee. Nearby, gleaming gold eyes pierce the gloom, and silky ears stiffen, attuned to the softest tremor. The tiger advances haltingly, intent on its prey, anticipating a moment of vulnerability. In a seamless motion, it leaps and descends upon its victim, its razor-sharp fangs sinking deep into the deer’s throat. As the deer’s life fades, its herd is already gone, evaporating into the night.\nLike the thrill inspired by a low, rumbling growl cutting through silence, Zoologist Tiger couples danger with majesty. Vetiver’s earthy body is licked with stripes of kumquat, saffron and jasmine in an elegant pattern. Incense lurks at the edges, shrouded by smoky undertones of papyrus and ebony wood. Tiger arouses intrigue, putting those around you on high alert.\nPerfumer: Cristiano CanaliSize: 1.5 mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Parfum Concentration: 20%Top Notes: Kumquat, Cardamom, Saffron Heart Notes: Sambac Jasmine, Incense, Carrot Seeds, SuedeBase Notes: Vetiver, Ebony Wood, Papyrus, Ambrette Seeds\nMade in Canada.
