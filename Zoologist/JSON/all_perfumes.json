An insatiable desire for sweetness propels the hummingbird as it floats from flower to flower, sampling the nectar with a gentle touch of its delicate tongue. Retreating to its lichen and moss-lined nest, it settles into the cozy cocoon and dreams of sweet ambrosia.\nZoologist Hummingbird mingles light floral tones with delectable fruity nectars to create a harmonious balance. This diaphanous scent alights upon you in a pastel bouquet of honeysuckle, mimosa, lilac and peonies, with just the lightest dusting of natural sugars found in pear, cherry and honey. A finishing dollop of velvety whipped cream melds the tantalizing notes, completing this irresistible and opulent perfume.",

Face down, guided by the sun, it propels the tightly-packed dung backwards to a burrow lined with dusky spheres. Underground, it tunnels into the ball to deposit a precious egg. In time, the larva hatches and feeds, until it emerges, fully formed, and instinct drives it down the same dusty trail to repeat the cycle.\nLike Egyptians entrusting sacred mummies to tombs for the journey to the next life, a scarab burying its treasure marks the dawn of new life. Zoologist Sacred Scarab captures the mystique of Kyphi incense, a blend of blue lotus, raisins, plums, olibanum, myrrh, and juniper. Once bound with wine and burned in ancient rituals, today this divine scent guides your spirit on a path to discovery and rebirth.",

Their predators lunge, only to be foiled by blinding jets of murky ink. The hunt ends abruptly as a monolith materializes, greedily engulfing all in its path. The massive sperm whale dives, leaving a temporary peace bobbing in its wake. Decades on, relics of the battle resurface. Lumps of ambergris, expelled by the whale and polished by the salty currents, wash ashore. Waste? Flotsam?

Long fangs give the buck a demonic appearance, but they too play a role in the mating ritual ‚Äì weapons in the tussle with rivals for a doe's love. The dream of a mate sustains the lonely musk deer as it searches out scraps of lichen and moss among cold, barren roots.\nFor centuries musk deer have been hunted to near extinction, coveted for their fragrant musk pods.

Stumbling drunkenly across the forest floor they feasted on overripe fruit where it lay, dropped for them by the lush island paradise that nurtured them. For generations, the predator-free and bountiful shores lulled them into such a state of complacency that their wings grew idle, and flight was lost ‚Äì even to memory. Ultimately evolution would betray them, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort.\nIn Zoologist Dodo, fragrant herbs and ferns are spiked with an invigorating splash of bergamot, juicy pineapple and blackcurrant, before the fruity aroma stumbles into a more traditional foug√®re. Spices frolic among notes of lavender, tonka and oakmoss, and settle down with beautiful woody undertones of oak. Dodo is a paradox. Like those extinct inhabitants of Mauritius, the scent is at once classic but fun, unknowable but impossibly unforgettable.

    "description": "Emperors they may be, but when a massive cyclone unleashes its merciless austral winds, the colony of penguins bow to its power. It's from such extremes that the male penguin must guard his precious bundle. Passed tenderly from mother to father, the egg is their shared purpose. She embarks on a perilous odyssey to the sea for food. He begins his own monotonous march, packed tightly in a circle of trudging penguins. So intent is he on protecting his egg that even the dazzling aurora australis against a lonely night sky escapes his notice.\nZoologist Penguin opens with saffron caught upon a salty blast of crisp antarctic air. Against the cool desolation, anticipation glimmers as lively aromas of pink pepper and sea moss swirl over musks, suede and sandalwood. Brace yourself for a vibrant scent that Is always invigorating, a reminder of nature‚Äôs harsh reality in a welcome blast.\nPerfumer: Chiaki NomuraSize: 1.5mL / 0.05 fl. oz.

    "description": "Their days are spent secluded in camouflage, the intricate pattern of their wings disguising them against a coarse backdrop of barks and rocks. When they finally stir, even their flight is concealed, shrouded beneath the cover of night. Moonlight ripples off a delicate coating of tiny hairs as their feathered antennae guide them in their search for a mate. Only one temptation can lure them from their quest. Should they succumb to the attraction of the flame, their urge to procreate may be quashed in a wisp of smoke and a smattering of ashes.\nAt first encounter, the rich, gothic scent of Zoologist Moth may surprise but soon it hypnotizes. A heavy dose of dark spices jolts your senses before settling into a dusting of honey-sweet rose and powdery florals. Slowly, it tests its wings, taking flight on an exotic journey of nagarmotha, guaiac wood and patchouli. Beneath it all lingers a smoky undertone that serves as a constant reminder of the danger within the tantalizing flame.\nPerfumer: Á®≤Ëëâ Êô∫Â§´ (Tomoo Inaba)Size:¬†1.5 mL / 0.05 Fl.

Trees soar to majestic heights and plants flower for the first time, their petals spreading to give birth to a world rich in diversity. The Cretaceous period comes of age against a backdrop scorched by wildfire and lightning strikes. Over this turbulent landscape, a massive predator looms. Giants rule the earth, but even giants can be cut down within the powerful jaws of the fearsome tyrannosaur. Standing tall, the terrifying beast fears nothing, until that pivotal moment when a fire in the sky signals the end of their deadly reign.\nZoologist Tyrannosaurus Rex is a gargantuan scent that sinks its teeth into the world of delicate fragrances and rips it wide open. Primitive woods and florals seize you and snatch you away to an ancient era.

The sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. The salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. Something stirs ‚Äì an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. Will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? No one knows. The secrets that lie beneath the skin of the chameleon keep Madagascar guessing.\nMadagascar, home to half of the world‚Äôs species of chameleons, holds the key to Zoologist Chameleon. Like the kaleidoscope of hues that swirl within the flesh of these exotic creatures, ylang dances with delicate frangipani upon your skin in a melody of creamy florals, while aphrodisiac vanilla blends with salty, silky musks to envelop you in the fruity, exotic atmosphere of the island.

    "description": "Climbing to its perch in the morning sky, the African sun reaches across a mountain range to caress a wide, flat boulder, baking it to a gentle heat. From the shade of a narrow crevice, a family of hyrax emerges, hot dust dulling the sheen of their golden fur. They settle onto the warm expanse of rock to partake in their ritual sunbath, but remain ever vigilant. The shadow of a soaring eagle rushes across the ground. With an urgent squeal, the alarm is sounded - the colony dashes for cover. As the heat from sweltering sun intensifies, ancient aromas are coaxed from the scorched rocks, sparse vegetation and petrified hyraceum. Eerily, they intertwine to form a scent that is both primitive and exotic, its animalistic tendencies tamed by an undercurrent of sweet florals.\nAt the heart of Zoologist Hyrax is a daring, seldom-used ingredient in the art of perfumery ‚Äì African stone, or hyraceum, giving this bold animalic scent its distinctive signature. This unique perfume skillfully blends saffron, pink pepper, whiskey, rose and musks to invoke an abstract image of a dusty African mountainscape. Like the nimble hyraxes that spill from hillside crevices in search of the sun upon their musky hides, this scent will weave its way into your senses with a light but primal touch.\nPerfumer: Sven Pritzkoleit Size: 1.5 mL / 0.05 Fl.

    "description": "On a trek through an unforgiving desert, starting point and destination are indistinguishable from one another. Terracotta-hued dunes twist and writhe, their shapes ever-shifting. Only the merciless sun and aloof constellations can be trusted to point the way. Weighed down by treasures ‚Äì some tempting the eyes with their glittering sheen, others enticing the taste buds with exotic aromas ‚Äì the camel plods toward a far off marketplace. Water is but a dream for now, the taste of sweet dates a distant memory. There is nothing but an endless ocean of sand.\nIn Zoologist Camel, beautiful aromas of rose, and jasmine-infused, succulent dried fruits are joined along the way by an alluring blend of incense, myrrh, amber, and cinnamon. Soon met by animalistic musks and authentic oud, they surround you in a rich tapestry. This sensual caravan of fragrance carries you away to accompany the camel on its long, lonely journey across the ageless desert.\nPerfumer: Christian CarbonnelSize:¬†1.5 mL /¬†0.05 Fl.

    "description": "The frail glow of the waning moon dwindles until only impenetrable blackness persists across the grasslands. A herd of deer venture tentatively into the expanse. Though their long necks dip to feed, their dainty legs remain tense, poised to flee. Nearby, gleaming gold eyes pierce the gloom, and silky ears stiffen, attuned to the softest tremor. The tiger advances haltingly, intent on its prey, anticipating a moment of vulnerability. In a seamless motion, it leaps and descends upon its victim, its razor-sharp fangs sinking deep into the deer‚Äôs throat. As the deer‚Äôs life fades, its herd is already gone, evaporating into the night.\nLike the thrill inspired by a low, rumbling growl cutting through silence, Zoologist Tiger couples danger with majesty. Vetiver‚Äôs earthy body is licked with stripes of kumquat, saffron and jasmine in an elegant pattern. Incense lurks at the edges, shrouded by smoky undertones of papyrus and ebony wood. Tiger arouses intrigue, putting those around you on high alert.\nPerfumer:¬†Cristiano CanaliSize:¬†1.5 mL /¬†0.05 fl. oz.Parfum Concentration: 20%Top Notes: Kumquat, Cardamom, Saffron Heart Notes: Sambac Jasmine, Incense, Carrot Seeds, SuedeBase Notes: Vetiver, Ebony Wood, Papyrus, Ambrette Seeds\nMade in Canada.

    "description": "Australian spring arrives, bearing dazzling frocks of yellow blossoms to dress the bare golden wattle trees. Clouds of sweet honeyed fragrance, caught upon the breeze, carry an invitation inland, where a flock of cockatiels happily take up the celebration. Emerging from dusty nests, the birds are ready to preen and prance. On a wobbly stage of branches, vivid crests bop to the rhythm of their joyous songs. After a final encore, the flock takes flight. Alighting in a nearby field they share a delightful brunch, buzzing with the thrill of their stunning recital.\nZoologist Cockatiel exudes joy. A sunny burst of yellow acacia offers a friendly welcome. Dots of raspberry and tart rhubarb suggest a hint of mischief, like a pair of rosy cheeks beneath a golden plume. Finally, soft notes of musk and vanilla enfold the vibrant Cockatiel, like downy feathers cushioning the brashness of this cheeky bird.\nüèÜ¬†2019 Arts and Olfaction Awards Winner¬†üèÜ\nZoologist Cockatiel was formerly known as ‚ÄúPowder and Dust‚Äù, a perfume created by Sven Pritzkoleit, published under his own brand, SP Parfums.

A tough, battered hide is his armour against the erosive onslaught of sand, whipped into a frenzy by a hot, merciless wind, as he stands strong, defending his domain.\nOn the first spray of Zoologist Rhinoceros, heady notes of sweet rum and whiskey collide with mellow coffee before the scent settles into its lingering journey. Rich leather, oud and incense are carried in a cloud of smoky red tobacco along a dusty amber path, dotted with hints of patchouli and moss. Rhinoceros is a sophisticated and robust scent that makes a bold, unapologetic statement. Go forth and explore your world.

Snow stretches as far as the eye can see, while a bitter wind rolls silently across the sky, its hush barely broken by the powerful beat of an ivory wing. Despite the stillness of the arctic, the snowy owl senses a flutter beneath the icy crust far below. Through snowy tunnels voles scamper, oblivious to their fate. A warm glow stirs within the breast of the majestic bird as it dives, confident in its mastery over the frigid kingdom.\nZoologist Snowy Owl glides on with a minty opening, while the gentle warmth of musk combines with beautiful hints of snowdrops, lily of the valley and iris.

What seems a peaceful transition actually raises a blaring alarm to the creatures below. Time is running out. But for generations, mighty oaks have fulfilled a promise to provide, and leaves are not the only bounty tumbling to the forest floor. Chipmunks scurry among the detritus in their quest to collect the plumpest acorns. They eagerly gather what they can and, cheeks bulging with nuts, scamper home to line their snug burrows before falling leaves give way to biting snow.\nZoologist Chipmunk captures an autumn forest bursting with ripe nuts. Juicy quince, dusted with cardamom and nutmeg, dangles tantalizingly among naturalistic woods and green, milky kernels.

On the lagoon floor, anemone and seaweed sway in unison, limbs pumping to the rhythm of the current. Hovering among the coral branches, a group of seahorses gazes shyly on. The pulsating beat calls to them and two pair off, their tails entwined in a delicate waltz. Soon their passion is spent, but the memory of the dance lives on. For the pouch of the male seahorse tenderly cradles a precious clutch of eggs.Zoologist Seahorse invites you to wade through a vibrant coral garden. This unisex scent turns expectation on its head.
