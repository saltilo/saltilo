    "description": "Balmy sunlight trips across foamy turquoise waves, sending rippling haloes onto the coral below. On the lagoon floor, anemone and seaweed sway in unison, limbs pumping to the rhythm of the current. Hovering among the coral branches, a group of seahorses gazes shyly on. The pulsating beat calls to them and two pair off, their tails entwined in a delicate waltz. Soon their passion is spent, but the memory of the dance lives on. For the pouch of the male seahorse tenderly cradles a precious clutch of eggs.Zoologist Seahorse invites you to wade through a vibrant coral garden. This unisex scent turns expectation on its head. With such surprising couplets as tuberose and seaweed, sage and neroli, and fennel and vetiver, this delightful melody will sweep you away on a wave of joy and abandon.\nPerfumer: Julien RasquinetSize: 1.5mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Perfume Concentration: 20%Top Notes: Guatemala Cardamom, Fennel, Ambrette Absolute Heart Notes: Clary Sage, Tuberose, Neroli Base Notes: Algae Absolute, Vetiver, Ambergris Accord*\n*Synthetic Notes.
