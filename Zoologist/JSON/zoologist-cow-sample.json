    "description": "Lush green pastures tumble toward the horizon, arching beneath the imposing silhouette of a mountain range. Cumulus clouds roll across a bright blue sky, their massive shadows gliding over a peacefully grazing herd. In a corner of the meadow, a tiny calf braces quivering limbs and, with a mighty lurch, stumbles up to take its maiden steps. Its velvet snout prods, rooting at its mother, until the release of warm milk signals a satisfying welcome to this vast new world.\nZoologist Cow brings to mind a bucolic scene, a myriad of scents from Mother Nature’s nurturing bosom. Innocent florals sway among soft grasses, while apple gently sweetens the soft aroma of fresh milk. The result is a place both familiar and reassuring, where warm arms unfold to welcome us into a loving embrace. A place called home.\nPerfumer: Nathalie FeisthauerSize: 1.5 mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Parfum Concentration: 18%Top Notes: Sage, AppleHeart Notes: Milk, Lily of the Valley, Heliotrope, Violet, JasmineBase Notes: Cedarwood, Vetiver, Benzoin, Musks*, Amber\n*Synthetic notes.
