    "title": "Zoologist Snowy Owl Sample",
    "description": "A thick carpet of silver envelops the landscape, untouched but for the dazzling reflection of the sun. Snow stretches as far as the eye can see, while a bitter wind rolls silently across the sky, its hush barely broken by the powerful beat of an ivory wing. Despite the stillness of the arctic, the snowy owl senses a flutter beneath the icy crust far below. Through snowy tunnels voles scamper, oblivious to their fate. A warm glow stirs within the breast of the majestic bird as it dives, confident in its mastery over the frigid kingdom.\nZoologist Snowy Owl glides on with a minty opening, while the gentle warmth of musk combines with beautiful hints of snowdrops, lily of the valley and iris. Sweet coconut and woody vanilla swoop in to surprise and entice. Snowy Owl merges cool vitality with exquisite softness in a captivating scent, ideal for those who aren't afraid to take what they desire.\nPerfumer: Dawn Spencer HurwitzParfum Concentration: 25%Size: 1.5mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Top Notes: Snow Accord, Lily of the Valley, Mint, CoconutHeart Notes: Iris, Snowdrop, White Rose, Mate, Frankincense, GalbanumBase Notes: Ambrette, Cedar, Civet*, Musks*, Oakmoss, Tonka, Vanilla\n*Synthetic notes.
