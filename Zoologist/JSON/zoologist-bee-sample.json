    "description": "üèÖ The Art & Olfaction Awards 2020, Independent Category Finalist\nThe spring day seems still and peaceful. Yet beneath the wildly splattered canvas of a blossom-strewn meadow, thousands engage in a desperate race for survival. Worker bees toil at a frantic pace, ferrying a precious cargo of nectar and pollen to deposit it within cramped honeycomb cells, where it will nurture drones and larvae under the eye of a regal queen. In the claustrophobic hive, a deafening buzz offers evidence of the bees' devotion to duty, not a single worker pausing to question its role in perpetual grind of life in the queendom.\nLike the frantic hustle of the bee through a maze of multi-faceted scents, Zoologist Bee delivers a surreal experience. The rich aroma of honey captivates, while alluring florals, royal jelly, animalic beeswax and regal incense unite to create a buzz, offering excitement, and the sweet rewards of life.\nPerfumer:¬†Cristiano CanaliSize:¬†1.5 mL / 0.05 Fl.
