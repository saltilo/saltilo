    "description": "The sun sparkled across rippling waves, its morning dance upon the Indian Ocean rousing the dodos from their carefree slumber. Stumbling drunkenly across the forest floor they feasted on overripe fruit where it lay, dropped for them by the lush island paradise that nurtured them. For generations, the predator-free and bountiful shores lulled them into such a state of complacency that their wings grew idle, and flight was lost – even to memory. Ultimately evolution would betray them, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort.\nIn Zoologist Dodo, notes of jackfruit and bergamot border a winding path dappled with aromatic turmeric and pink pepper. Venture along it to the heart of an island forest where hints of powdery orris emerge from beneath a potpourri of lavender, geranium, and orange flower. Soothed by the comforting florals, you’ll soon surrender, sinking into the loam where woody tonka and sandalwood sprout from an earthy base of patchouli and vetiver.\nPerfumer: Yves CassarSize: 1.5 mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Parfum Concentration: 20%Top Notes: Jackfruit Accord, Bergamot, Pink Pepper, Turmeric LeafHeart Notes: Lavender, Geranium, Orange Flower, Turmeric Root, Orris ConcreteBase Notes: Tonka, Vetiver, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Labdanum\nMade in Canada.
