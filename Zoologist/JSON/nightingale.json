    "description": "⭐ Fragrantica.com's Best Perfumes of 2016, Editors' Choice\nMessengers of spring arrive, bearing gifts that bring smiles to faces dulled by winter’s chill. The joyous song of the nightingale accompanies vibrant fuchsia-colored aromas of Japanese plum blossoms as they spread, infusing the tepid air. It marks a fleeting moment of emotional awaking: to some a time for celebration and fresh starts; to others, a countdown to a departure for unknown horizons.\nZoologist captures the onset of the Japanese spring through Nightingale, a pink floral chypre that will melt your heart. It opens with rich scents of saffron and rosy, powdery, tart Japanese plum blossoms, enveloping the core of the perfume like a luxurious silk kimono. Deep, warm aromas of oud, patchouli, moss, incense and ambergris seek to escape, seeping from the ruddy petals, to create a composition that’s complex and at the same time, simply desirable.\nPerfumer: 稲葉 智夫 (Tomoo Inaba)Parfum Concentration: 20%Size: 60 mL / 2 fl. oz.Top Notes: Bergamot, Lemon, SaffronHeart Notes: Japanese Plum Blossom, Red Rose, VioletBase Notes: Oud, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Moss, Frankincense, White Musk*, Labdanum, Ambergris*\n*Synthetic notes.
