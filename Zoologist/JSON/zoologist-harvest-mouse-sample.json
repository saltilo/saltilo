    "description": "Autumn winds skip across golden wheat fields. As the tall grasses billow, the rattle of husks beats a soft prairie lullaby, signalling to the weary sun to rest. In the fading light, tiny harvest mice venture forth, scrambling to gather seeds and fruits. For once the sun sinks fully beneath the horizon, its rule of the sky is bestowed on another. And when the coo of the owl breaks the night, the mice dash, trembling, back to their nests.\nLike a countryside bathed in sweet sunlight, Zoologist Harvest Mouse conjures images of home-baked goodness. Stalks of wheat sway among chamomile, davana and hay, and rich beer extracts are sobered by resins and woody notes. Cozy up in a warm nest of homespun scent.\nPerfumer: Luca MaffeiSize: 1.5 mL / 0.05 Fl.
