    "description": "Under the searing gaze of an unrelenting sun, the ornery rhinoceros surveys his dusty territory. A tough, battered hide is his armour against the erosive onslaught of sand, whipped into a frenzy by a hot, merciless wind, as he stands strong, defending his domain.\nOn the first spray of Zoologist Rhinoceros, heady notes of sweet rum and whiskey collide with mellow coffee before the scent settles into its lingering journey. Rich leather, oud and incense are carried in a cloud of smoky red tobacco along a dusty amber path, dotted with hints of patchouli and moss. Rhinoceros is a sophisticated and robust scent that makes a bold, unapologetic statement. Go forth and explore your world. Donâ€™t ask permission.\nThis perfume is a new interpretation by perfumer Prin Lomros. The original version, designed by Paul Kiler, is discontinued and no longer available.\nPerfumer: Prin LomrosSize: 1.5mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Parfum Concentration: 20% Top Notes: Pink Pepper, Whiskey, Coffee, Rum, Basil Middle Notes: Leather*, Incense, Tobacco Absolute, Flouve, Ylang Ylang Base Notes: Laos Oud, Patchouli, Nargamotha, Oakmoss, Amber\n*Synthetic notes.
