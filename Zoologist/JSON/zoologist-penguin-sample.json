    "description": "Emperors they may be, but when a massive cyclone unleashes its merciless austral winds, the colony of penguins bow to its power. It's from such extremes that the male penguin must guard his precious bundle. Passed tenderly from mother to father, the egg is their shared purpose. She embarks on a perilous odyssey to the sea for food. He begins his own monotonous march, packed tightly in a circle of trudging penguins. So intent is he on protecting his egg that even the dazzling aurora australis against a lonely night sky escapes his notice.\nZoologist Penguin opens with saffron caught upon a salty blast of crisp antarctic air. Against the cool desolation, anticipation glimmers as lively aromas of pink pepper and sea moss swirl over musks, suede and sandalwood. Brace yourself for a vibrant scent that Is always invigorating, a reminder of natureâ€™s harsh reality in a welcome blast.\nPerfumer: Chiaki NomuraSize: 1.5mL / 0.05 fl. oz.
