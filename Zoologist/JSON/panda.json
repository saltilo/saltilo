    "description": "An encounter with a lovable panda is as unforgettable as the exotic forest it calls home. Like the majestic mosaic of dewy greens, and enchanting aromas of florals and fruits, this creature exudes a vibrance as light and playful as a Sichuan breeze.\nThe opening of this oriental fragrance envelops you in a joyous embrace - osmanthus, magnolia, lily, juicy apple and mandarin tumble over one another in a happy melee to create a moment of pure joy. As the scent gently settles, you find yourself meandering through a shadowy corridor of bamboo, where subtle hints of jasmine, amber, and musks peek out from behind fresh green leaves, leading you to a tranquil oasis. In the quiet calm, a carefree exuberance rolls over you, lifting your spirits to a magical place where panda roam and play.\nThis perfume is a new interpretation by perfumer Christian Carbonnel. The original version, designed by Paul Kiler, is discontinued and no longer available.\nPerfumer: Christian CarbonnelSize: 60 mL / 2 fl. oz.
