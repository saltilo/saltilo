    "description": "üèÖ The Art & Olfaction Awards 2017, Independent Category Finalist\nAs the sun sinks over the dense tropical forest, civets emerge warily from the thickets. Under a carpet of narcotic flower blossoms, a smattering of coffee berries peppers the ground. The moist air is heavy with mossy aromas that penetrate every crevice, but the musky scent of the civets dominates; their marked territory daring one to enter at one‚Äôs own risk.\nZoologist Civet pays homage to the age-old ingredient, civet, as well as chypre perfumes of bygone days ‚Äì perfumes that refused to be intimidated by raw, alluring, animalistic musks. Civet is a moody and complex brew entwined in mystery. It opens with a spicy floral accord, threaded through with dark coffee tones. Slowly it prowls forward, unraveling base notes of leather, moss and vanilla that combines with distinctive civet musk to create a bewildering, sophisticated scent with the promise of a sultry nighttime rendezvous.\nPerfumer: Shelley WaddingtonParfum Concentration: 25%Size: 60 mL / 2 fl. oz.Top Notes: Bergamot, Black Pepper, Lemon, Orange, Spices, TarragonHeart Notes: Carnation, Frangipani, Heliotrope, Hyacinth, Linden-blossom, Tuberose, YlangBase Notes: Balsams, Civet*, Coffee, Incense, Labdanum, Musks*, Oakmoss, Resins, Russian Leather*, Vanilla, Vetiver, Woods \n*Synthetic notes.
