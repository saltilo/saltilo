    "description": "With its vibrant, sun-dappled hues, the dense rainforest beckons invitingly. Yet within its misty depths, countless dangers lurk, slinking across the forest floor. Dangling high among the treetops may seem a dubious defence against peril, but for leisurely sloths the forest canopy offers a protective shroud. Safe in their leafy fortress, the sluggish creatures move so slowly even moss overtakes them. They snooze in a cradle of moist green aromas, oblivious to the chaos below.\nZoologist Sloth captures the tranquility of this sleepy beast in a soothing green essence. Calming lavender, chamomile, marigold and jasmine combine with the stillness of bittersweet hay and damp moss, stitched together by threads of luscious incense. The result is dreamy and exotic. As it settles on the skin, Sloth carries one up to a place where stresses simply tumble away.\nPerfumer: Prin LomrosSize: 1.5mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Perfume Concentration: 20%Top Notes: Chamomile, Açaí Berry, Lavender, Violet LeafHeart Notes: Marigold, Beeswax, Anise, Jatamansi, Jasmine, CuminBase Notes: Hay, Frankincense, Myrrh, Mushroom, Oakmoss, Vanilla, Tonka\nZoologist Sloth contains beeswax and bees are not harmed in its harvesting.\nMade in Canada.
