    "description": "Mystical, mysterious murmurings glide upon a blanket of inky sky. Shadows smear across the moonlight, their darting journey shrouded in darkness. Bats, the only mammal capable of true flight, are enigmatic and alien.\nZoologist Bat escorts you on an odyssey through the night. This unique olfactory experience carries you with the fruit bat to a sumptuous feast in a lush tropical jungle, before whisking you down to the recesses of its cavernous home. Sweet guavas and passion fruits ensnare you with addictive notes, then beckon you deep with primordial mineral scents that evoke a rugged enclosure redolent with hints of damp soil and vegetal roots. Allow yourself to hang, draped in pitch black, as alluring musk wafts over you with every unfolding of the thousands of leathery wings that surround you.\nThis perfume is a new interpretation of a fruit bat living in the tropics by perfumer Prin Lomros. The original version, designed by Ellen Covey, is discontinued and no longer available.\nPerfumer: Prin LomrosSize: 1.5 mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Parfum Concentration: 20%Top Notes: Fig, Passion Fruit, Pink Guava, Soil Accord Heart Notes: Hay, Incense, Minerals, Night Blooming JasmineBase Notes: Animalic Notes*, Leather*, Mossy Stones, Teak Wood, Vetiver\n*Synthetic notes.
