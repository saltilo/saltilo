    "description": "Branches lay bare against a grey sky. The gaiety of summer has given way to doldrums of fall, and as winter settles in, flocks take flight, like guests from a dwindling party. But one pair of revellers lingers on, he in crimson finery, she in demure tones. Among tattered streamers of copper leaves, they warble a merry duet. Around the cardinals' nest, tinsel icicles may have replaced vibrant blooms of roses, but as they feast on scarlet berries that dot the snowy landscape, this feathered brood's festive spirit refuses to be chilled.\nZoologist Northern Cardinal combines the invigorating scents of bergamot, rose and rich hints of leather. Tart green notes entwine with handsome undertones to encircle you in a subtle wreath of fragrance. Cloak yourself in this warm, cheerful perfume, a spark of joy on a bleak winter day.\nPerfumer: Rosendo MateuSize: 1.5 mL / 0.05 fl. oz.Parfum Concentration: 14%Top Notes: Lemon, Bergamot, Mandarin, Green Leaves Middle Notes: Rose, Clary Sage, Leather Base Notes: Vanilla, Oakmoss, Musk*, Patchouli\n*Synthetic notes.
